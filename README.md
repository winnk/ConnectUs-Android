## Description
An Android application enabling people to manage their phsician appointments. Physician searches are provied via the betterdoctor.com API which returns a list of phsycisians in their area who can address their symptoms. Addtionally, appoinments can be saved in the calendar and notes for appointments can be saved. Future development is connecting a second API to research symptoms and attach images to notes.
